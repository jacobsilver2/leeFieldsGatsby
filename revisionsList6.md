- [x] On the newsletter portion, can we also add back in a little space between the headline and the form, but keep both centered in the space? Mainly on desktop, the email line seems like it got longer. Not sure if that was deliberate, but maybe shorten it like 1.5 "e-mail" widths amount?

> Ok I added a bit of space between the Title and Form. Lemme know if that's good!
> I didn't do anything to make the form longer...I just shortened it a bit though, lemme know if it's enough.

- [x] For about body copy, it looks good on mobile. But maybe a tiny bit of tracking on desktop as well to help legibility.

- [x] On desktop music page, there are some instances when resizing my brower, where the buy/listen falls beneath the image. Not the worst thing, but if it can be maintained, great! See screenshot.

> That was a weird one...it was happening when the title text was more than 2 lines. I believe that is fixed now.
