◻️ On the announcement banner, could we reduce the spacing between the black and grey lines? Maybe by about 2/3rds?

`this is code. I'm testing to see if this works well as a commenting system.`

◻️ On the videos, I thought that we were going to go with a hosted video vs custom player, but I am liking it without! Feels sleeker without a bar over the video! On the homepage, I’m feeling like I want almost no controls at all…wonder if maybe could use a mouse hover to indicate to press play instead of something always present. I don't mind having the sound option if it was more discrete, but not sure if it's super necessary. The only pro I think of having it is being able to watch a full video from the homepage since once you open the modal it would have to start over?

◻️ For the logo changing from large to small, can it feel more seamless like one object rather than two…Something more like this. However, I noticed that a lot of examples are only changing the size/position, whereas with ours we’d have to change from 3 lines to 1 line and the font style…is that possible? If not, I think there is an alternate solution we can discuss.

◻️ On the tour dates, can it only hover on tickets and not the city?

◻️ The column/scaling/spacing on the shop page is a bit odd. Is it possible to maintain the small margin style? If not, maybe should just be centered?

◻️ On the email sign up can it not have a blue outline/bg when typing?

◻️ On the type weights…could it be like when we specify the “font-weight: 500; font-style: normal;” that’s throwing it off? Can we see how a lighter weight looks/did it appear closer to how we had it that way?

# Mobile

◻️ Can we have a two-line menu icon instead of three lines?

◻️ Still thinking on this…but curious about having the menu take up the whole screen…

◻️ For info, maybe we could make it one page and put the contact info under the bio…or maybe something like this although it probably works better since they have 4 categories rather than 2.

◻️ For tour dates, wonder if we can/need it to go slightly bigger on the point size.

◻️ Like the altered footer, music, and shop.

◻️ Thinking on if we need to think through an alternate video modal on mobile.
